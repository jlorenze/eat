ingredients:
- 3 Tbsp vegetable oil
- 3 eggs, whisked
- 1 small white onion, finely chopped
- 2 medium carrots, finely chopped
- 2 cups additional veggies, cut into small pieces

- 1 Tbsp fresh ginger, finely minced
- 2 large cloves garlic, minced

- 1 cup uncooked brown rice
- 1 cup spinach (optional)

- Add remaining vegetables and salt and cook until veggies are cooked through (~3-5 min). Transfer all vegetables to the bowl with the eggs
- Let the skillet reheat and add 1 Tbsp oil. Add ginger, garlic, and red pepper flakes and cook for 30 seconds until fragrant, stirring constantly. Add rice and mix together
- Cook rice, stirring occasionally, until rice starts to turn golden on edges (~3-5 min)
- Add the spinach and green onions and stir to combine. Add the remaining vegetables and eggs and stir to combine
- Remove skillet from heat and stir in soy sauce and sesame oil. Adjust soy sauce, sesame oil, and salt to taste
