ingredients:
- 71 g (5 Tbsp) water
- 269 g (<1.5 cups) whole milk
- 524 g (<5 cups) King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour
- 35 g (1/4 cup) nonfat dry milk
- 1.75 tsp salt
- 1 Tbsp instant yeast
- 2 large eggs
- 113 g (8 Tbsp) unsalted butter, melted
- 142 g (3/4 cup) brown sugar
- 4 tsp ground cinnamon
- 227 g (2 cups) confectioners' sugar
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
directions:
- Make starter by combining 71 g (5 Tbsp) each of water and whole milk with 28 g (3.3 Tbsp) flour, whisking constantly over medium heat until thick and streaks remain on bottom of pan (~1-2 min). Remove from heat
- Combine starter with remaining 496 g (4 cups + 2 Tbsp) flour, dry milk, salt, yeast, 170 g (3/4 cup) lukewarm whole milk, eggs, and 85 g (6 Tbsp) melted butter
- Mix until everything comes together, then cover and let rest for 20 min. Knead by hand or mixer until the dough is smooth and elastic (but will be somewhat sticky)
- Shape the dough into a ball and let it rest in a greased covered bowl for 1 to 1.5 hours, until puffy but not necessarily doubled in volume
- Meanwhile, combine and mix brown sugar and cinnamon and jam to some groovy tunes
- Gently remove dough from bowl and divide in half
- Working with one piece at a time, shape dough into 18" x 8" rectangle and sprinkle over top half of the cinnamon mixture. Roll the dough into a log along the long edge, pinch the seam and roll so the seam is underneath. Cut log into 12 pieces using dental floss
- Place rolls into a lightly greased 9" x 13" pan and evenly space
- Cover pan and let rolls rise for 1 hour, until crowding each other and puffy
- Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350F with rack in bottom third
- Make icing by stirring together confectioners' sugar, a pinch of salt, 28 g (2 Tbsp) melted butter, vanilla extract, and 28-43 g whole milk (2-3 Tbsp). Use enough milk to make icing spreadable but still thick (like cream cheese thickness)
- Bake rolls for 22-25 minutes, until they feel set (not necessarily browned). Better to underbake than overbake
- Move rolls to wire rack to cool, and spread with icing to let it melt into the rolls
- Serve warm or let completely cool and store for a couple of days at room temperature. Can also freeze unfrosted rolls for up to one month

notes:
- The starter is called "tangzhong"
- Letting the dough rest allows the flour to absorb the liquid
- Avoid adding a bunch of extra flour during kneading
- To reheat frozen rolls, thaw overnight in refrigerator, reheat in 350F oven for 10 min under aluminum foil tent
- From King Arthur Flour
