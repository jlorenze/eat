ingredients:
- 411g (100%, 3.5 cups) all-purpose flour
- 265g (65%, 2/3 + 1/2 cups) water
- 1.25 tsp salt
- 2 + 1/8 tsp instant yeast
- 1 egg white
directions:
- Make starter by mixing 85g (3/4 cup) flour, 113g (1/2 cup) lukewarm water, and 1/8 tsp yeast. Cover and ferment overnight at room temperature
- Combine remaining 326g (2.75 cups) flour, 152g (2/3 cup) lukewarm water, 2 tsp yeast, and salt. Add starter and mix and knead by hand until smooth. You should be able to knead it without adding additional flour
- Let dough rise in a covered, lightly greased bowl at room temperature until very puffy (~90 min). Turn over and gently deflate after first 45 min
- Lightly oil a working surface. Turn out dough and divide into four equally sized portions
- Gather each piece into a ball and then roll into cylinders. Flatten slightly and gently, removing any large air bubbles
- Place loaves on parchment-lined baking sheet. Cover and let rise until doubled in size (~45 min)
- Preheat oven to 425F
- Beat egg white with 1 Tbsp water. Brush rolls with egg wash and then bake for 20-25 minutes, or until golden
- Transfer to rack to cool. Store (well-wrapped) at room temperature for several days, or freeze
