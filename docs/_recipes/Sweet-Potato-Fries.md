ingredients:
- 2 lbs sweet potatoes, peeled
- 2 Tbsp olive oil
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp paprika
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 1 tsp salt
directions:
- Preheat oven to 400F. Cut sweet potatoes into sticks
- Toss potatoes with olive oil, garlic powder, paprika, and black pepper, spread out on two baking sheets
- Bake until brown and crisp on bottom (~15 min), then flip and bake until other side is crisp (~10 min)
- Season with salt
notes:
- Definitely best fresh
- Spacing is very important, otherwise they end up steaming and wont get crispy
- Try soaking the potatoes after cutting, for about an hour, and also toss in 2 Tbsp corn starch before tossing with oil and spices
