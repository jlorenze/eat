- 440g (80%) room temperature water
- 11g (2%, 2 tsp) salt
- 2g (0.5%, 1/2 + 1/4 tsp) instant dried yeast
directions:
- Mix 200g flour, 200g water, and 1/4 tsp yeast until will combined. Cover and ferment at room temperature for 12-18 hours
- In mixer bowl, combine starter with remaining 350g flour, 240g water, 1/2 tsp yeast, and 2 tsp salt
- Using paddle attachment, mix on low until flour is moistened and then at medium-low speed until the dough forms a mass and pulls away from the sides of the bowl (~6 min)
- Switch to dough hook and mix on med-low until dough is smooth and shiny (~10 min)
- Transfer dough to a greased container. Cover and let rise for 1 hour
- Gently fold once per quarter-turn, gently flip dough, then let rest 45 minutes. Repeat two more times
- Preheat oven to 450F for one hour with cast-iron skillet on bottom rack and baking stone/baking sheet on low-middle rack
- Turn out dough onto a floured surface and liberally dust the top with flour, being careful not to deflate the dough!
- Shape the dough into a square using bench scrapers, cut in half, and then transfer gently to a floured parchment paper place on another baking sheet or cutting board (for transport)
- Lightly dimple each loaf and gently shape as desired, then cover and proof for 30 minutes until puffy
- Spritz the dough with lukewarm water and slide parchment paper onto baking stone/sheet. Drop a cup of ice into the cast-iron pan and quickly close oven door
- Bake until deep golden brown (~20-25 minutes)

notes:
- This dough has very high hydration, and is therefore easiest to make using a mixer. It should have a thick batter consistency after mixing
