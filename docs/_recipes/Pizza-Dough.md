ingredients:
- 1000g (100%, 7.75 cups) all-purpose white flour
- 700g (70%, 3 cups) water, 90-95F
- 20g (2%, 4 tsp) fine sea salt
- 2g (0.2%, 1/2 tsp) instant dried yeast
directions:
- In small container, hydrate yeast by adding to a few tablespoons of the water
- Autolyse, combining 1000g (for 5 pizzas) flour and remaining water at 90-95F and mixing. Then cover and let rest for 20-30 minutes
- Sprinkle salt and pour yeast mixture evenly over dough. Mix by hand, using the fold and cut technique until the ingredients are fully integrated. Let rest for a couple minutes, then fold until dough tightens
- Cover and let dough rise until double in volume (~6 hours), applying one fold during first hour. After folding, lightly coat the dough and container with olive oil
- Divide dough into 350g pieces (5 pieces per 1000g flour)
- Shape dough into medium-tight balls and place on floured baking sheet
- Lightly dust tops with flour and cover with plastic wrap, proof for 30-60 minutes. Then refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to make shaping easier
