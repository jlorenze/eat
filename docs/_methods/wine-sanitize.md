title: Sanitizing Wine and Cider Equipment
tag: wine-sanitize
layout: method
steps:
- First, wash or scrub off any visible dirt with water.
- Use PBW (Professional Brewery Wash), which is safe for use on stainless steel, glass, and plastic.
- Soak equipment in solution of PBW and warm water (3/4 oz PBW per gallon water) for 30 minutes, or longer for tough jobs.
- Scrub surfaces, but be careful to not use abrasive pads or stiff brushes on plastic. For plastic, use a microfiber dishcloth.
- Thoroughly rinse with warm water.
notes:
- Everything that could potentially come in contact with the wine should be sanitized, including fermentors, bottles, wine thief, stirring equipment, bungs, airlocks, hydrometer, etc.
- Steps may vary for different cleaning products.
