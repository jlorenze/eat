title: Hand Mixing Wet Dough
tag: hand-mix-wet-dough
layout: method
steps:
- Mix very thoroughly for several minutes with wooden spoon and then let rest for half hour for flour to absorb the water as much as possible.
- Apply several folds to help develop the gluten.
notes:
- High hydration doughs (such as ciabatta) are very hard to mix by hand. However, you should avoid adding extra flour!
- Don't expect as much gluten development as if using a mixer, so your dough may not keep its desired shape as much since it won't have the required structure for support.
