layout: method
steps:
- None
notes:
- Main variables are juice type (apple variety), sugar quantity, acid level, tannins, and yeast type.
- Fresh juice (unpasteurized) is ideal, but store bought pasteurized juice also works fine.
- Do not use juices with preservatives, such as potassium sorbate.
- Highly acidic juices will mellow somewhat after primary fermentaiton unless sulfites are added.
- Tannins can be added to give a dry finish and can also clarify the cider and act as an antiseptic. Generally scant 1/4 tsp per gallon is sufficient.
- Can also experiment by adding some other fruit juices, such as cranberry or blueberry!
- There are specific cider yeasts, which are similar to champagne yeasts.
