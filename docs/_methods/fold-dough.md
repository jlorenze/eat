title: Folding Dough
tag: fold-dough
layout: method
steps:
- Reach underneath and grab a quarter of the dough.
- Stetch gently to the point of resistance (avoid tearing).
- Fold over the top to the other side and gently press in.
- Turn the dough a quarter turn and repeat for the remaining three sides.
notes:
- Folding the dough aligns and stretches gluten strands.
- Often used as an alternative to kneading, for situations where a higher rise and larger air pockets are desired.
