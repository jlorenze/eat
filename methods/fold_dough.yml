title: Folding Dough
tag: fold-dough
steps: 
  - Reach underneath and grab a quarter of the dough.
  - Stetch gently to the point of resistance (avoid tearing).
  - Fold over the top to the other side and gently press in.
  - Turn the dough a quarter turn and repeat for the remaining three sides.
  - Invert the dough to help maintain tension.
notes:
  - Folding the dough aligns and stretches gluten strands.
  - Often used as an alternative to kneading, for situations where a higher rise and larger air pockets are desired.
