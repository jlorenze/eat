Ingredients:
3 Tbsp whole wheat or AP flour
1 Tbsp ground chili powder
1 tsp ground cumin
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/4 tsp dried oregano
1/4 tsp salt
pinch of cinnamon
3 Tbsp olive oil

2 cups vegetable broth
2 Tbsp chopped fresh cilantro
1 tsp apple cider vinegar
5 oz corn tortilla chips

Make:
1. Combine flour, chili powder, garlic powder, oregano, salt, and cinnamon in a small bowl.
2. Heat oil in small sauce pan over medium heat until a light sprinkle of flour sizzles. Add flour and spice mixture, whisk constantly until fragrant (~1 minute).
3. Whisk in tomato paste and then slowly pour broth while whisking continuously.
4. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat and simmer until sauce has thickened (5-7 minutes), stirring constantly.
5. Whisk in cilantro and vinegar.
6. Fry eggs in a large skillet in some extra oil, set aside.
7. Add chips to skillet, pour sauce over top, and stir with flexible spatula until well coated. Remove from heat when desired softness is reached.
8. Top with queso fresco, radish, avocado, cilantro, and fried eggs. Serve with refried beans on the side if desired.
9. Serve promptly to avoid too soggy chips.

Notes:
1. Only cook the amount of chips that will be eaten right away, but some of the sauce can be reserved and refrigerated for leftovers.
2. The chips will continue to get slightly softer after removed from heat.
