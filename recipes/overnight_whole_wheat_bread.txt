3. Cover and let dough rise until ~triple in volume (~5 hours), applying three folds during first 2 hours. <fold-dough>
4. If needed, divide dough.
5. Dust proofing baskets with flour, shape dough into medium-tight balls and place seam side down in baskets. <shape-dough>
6. Lightly dust tops with flour, place basket into nonperforated plastic bags, and refrigerate overnight (~12-14 hours).
7. Place dutch oven in oven and preheat to 475F 45 min prior to baking.
8. Bake 30 min with lid on and then 15 min with lid off (to desired crust color). Bake loaf seam side up.

Notes:
1. Dough can go straight into dutch oven from the refrigerator.
2. Shaped dough can also be proofed at room-temp for faster rise time if desired.
