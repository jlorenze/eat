Ingredients:
1/2 lb whole wheat pasta
1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
1 tsp Dijon mustard
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 tsp dried Italian herbs
1 tsp salt
2 tbsp olive oil
2 cups broccoli
8 oz sliced mushrooms
1 red bell pepper, cut in 1" pieces
1 zucchini, cut
1 yellow squash, cut
1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved
1 red onion, cut into 1" pieces
15 oz can cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan
red pepper flakes
1 cup basil
1 clove garlic
1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan
salt
pepper
2.5 tbsp olive oil

Make:
1. Preheat oven to 425F.
2. In large pot of salted water, cook pasta.
3. Whisk together balsamic dressing ingredients (balsamic vinegar - olive oil).
4. Dress vegetables with mixture, roast on 2 sprayed sheet pans for ~20 min, tossing halfway through.
5. Make pesto by processing ingredients (basil - olive oil) and slowly adding oil.
5. Combine pasta, 1/3 cup pesto, beans, roasted vegetables, and Parmesan. Drizzle with balsamic vinegar and top with red pepper flakes if desired.
6. Serve hot or cold.

Notes:
1. Can also just use 1 lb pasta if desired. In this case also double the amount of pesto.
2. Could also reserve a bit of pasta water to add at the end.
3. Perhaps omit the onion, it is a bit much.
