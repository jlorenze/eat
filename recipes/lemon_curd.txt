Lemon Curd

Yield:

Time (hours): 0.25

Keywords: sauces, dessert

Recommended Sides:

Ingredients:
4 large egg yolks
2/3 cup granulated sugar
1 Tbsp lemon zest
1/3 cup fresh lemon juice (2-3 lemons)
1/8 tsp salt
6 Tbsp unsalted butter, room temperature

Make:
1. Mix together egg yolks, sugar, zest, juice, and salt and cook in double boiler over simmering water or in a heavy bottomed pan over medium-low heat.
2. Continuously whisk and cook until mixture thickens slightly (~10 minutes). This should occur before a simmer occurs. If curd isn't thickening, turn up heat slightly.
3. Remove from heat, cut butter into pieces and whisk into the curd until melted and combined.
4. Pour into jar or bowl and place piece of plastic wrap directly on top (to avoid a skin forming while cooling).
5. Chill in refrigerator until cool, keep refrigerated for up to ~10 days.

Notes:
1. Makes about 1-1.5 cups.
2. Can use a double boiler for better temperature control to ensure no burning. Otherwise ensure a heavy sauce pan is used and to continue stirring constantly.
3. Use a silicone whisk to avoid metallicy flavors being introduced.
