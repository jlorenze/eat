Recommended Sides:

Ingredients:
964g (100%, 8 cups) unbleached all-purpose flour
680g (70%, 3 cups) lukewarm water
14g (1.5%, 1 Tbsp) salt
12g (1.25%, 1 Tbsp) instant yeast

Make:
1. Mix the ingredients until there are no dry spots.
2. Knead the dough by hand for a few minutes, or 1-2 minutes in a stand mixer.
3. Cover the container and let the dough rise for 2 hours at room temperature and then refrigerate overnight.
4. Divide the dough into 4 equal portions, and shape into a rough, slightly flattened oval.
5. Fold the dough in half lengthwise and seal the edges with the heel of your hand. Flatten slightly and repeat.
6. With seam side down, roll dough into a 15 inch log.
7. Place seam side down onto parchment-lined baking sheet (or into well of baguette pan).
8. Cover and let rise until very puffy (~1.5 hours). Towards end of rise time preheat oven to 450F.
9. Score the baguette 3 or 4 times.
10. Spritz heavily with warm water, and bake until deep golden brown (~25-30 min). Cool on a wire rack.

Notes:
1. The dough can be refrigerated for up to 7 days and made later as well.
