Keywords: meat, american

Recommended Sides:

Ingredients:
1 Tbsp olive oil
1 Tbsp unsalted butter
1.5 lbs chicken (breasts or thighs)
salt
pepper
1/2 lb mild pork sausage, casings removed
1/2 yellow onion, chopped
1 red bell pepper, diced
2 celery stalks, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
1.5 cups long-grain white rice, rinsed
1 bay leaf
3 cups low-sodium chicken broth
1 cup frozen peas
handful sliced scallions

Make:
1. In a large skillet with a lid, heat oil and butter over med-high heat until butter foam subsides. Season chicken generously with salt and pepper and add to pan.
2. Cook chicken without moving until golden brown (~6 min).
3. Flip chicken and cook an additional 5 minutes. Transfer to platter and pour off all but 2 Tbsp of fat.
4. Add sausage and cook over med-high heat, stirring and breaking up the meat, until browned (~3 min).
5. Reduce heat to medium and add onions, peppers, celery, garlic, and cayenne. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are softened (~8 min).
5. Add rice and bay leaf and cook, stirring often, until rice is lightly toasted.
6. Add broth, stir to combine, and add reserved chicken and accumulated juices. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer (covered) until chicken is cooked through and rice is tender (~20 min). Add peas after 15 minutes.
7. Let pan sit, covered, for 5 to 10 minutes after taking off heat. Adjust seasonings and add scallions if desired.

Notes:
1. A simplified Cajun and Creole staple.
2. If chicken is ready before rice, transfer chicken to platter and keep warm until rice is done.
