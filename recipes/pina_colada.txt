Pina Colada

Yield: 2

Time (hours): 0.5

Keywords: drinks

Recommended Sides: 

Ingredients:
8-10 oz pineapple (1/4 fresh pineapple), peeled, cut into large cubes
6 oz (1.5 cups) ice cubes
2 fl oz sweetened cream of coconut
1 fl oz unsweetened coconut milk
4 fl oz white rum
1 Tbsp lime juice
Maraschino cherries
lime wedges

Make:
1. Freeze pineapple in plastic bag, laying them flat so they don't stick together as much (~3 hours).
2. Shake cream of coconut and coconut milk to mix before measuring.
3. In a blender, puree pineapple, ice, cream of coconut, coconut milk, white rum, and lime juice until smooth.
4. Chill in freezer (still in blender) until thickened (~30 min).
5. Blend again for a couple of seconds, serve topped with cherries and lime wedges if desired.

Notes:
1. To freeze a whole pineapple ahead of time (for up to 3 months), cut into large cubes and place separated on baking sheet. Once frozen transfer to plastic bags. This makes them much easier to separate after!
