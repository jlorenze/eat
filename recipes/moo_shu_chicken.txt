2. Stir together 2 Tbsp hot water, 1 Tbsp hoisin, 1 Tbsp oyster, 1 tsp soy sauce, and 1/2 tsp sesame oil in bowl, set aside.
3. Make sure garlic, cabbage, mushrooms, and bamboo shoots are ready.
4. Pour 1 Tbsp oil in heated cast iron skillet and pour in beaten eggs to make an omelet. Cut into thin strips and set aside.
5. Heat 1 Tbsp oil until almost smoking, sear chicken on all sides until just done, set aside.
6. Heat 1 Tbsp oil on med-high heat, add garlic, followed immediately by cabbage, shiitake mushroom, and bamboo shoots. Stir for one minute, then add Shaoxing wine and stir fry for 30 more seconds.
7. Add sauce mixture, cooked chicken, egg, and scallions and combine.
8. Serve with pancakes or tortillas and extra hoisin sauce.

Notes:
1. Mandarin pancakes take a while to make, so can substitute tortillas instead.
2. Light soy sauce is the more common type, e.g. Lee Kum Kee Premium Soy Sauce.
3. Shiitake mushrooms should be soaked in warm water for ~30 minutes and then gently squeezed to remove excess water.
