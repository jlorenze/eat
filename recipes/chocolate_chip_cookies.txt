Chocolate Chip Cookies

Yield: 24

Time (hours): 0.5

Keywords: dessert

Recommended Sides: milk

Ingredients:
160 g (~11 Tbsp) butter, softened
200 g (1 cup) sugar
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1 large egg
230 g (1.5 generous cups) all-purpose flour
salt
1 tsp baking soda
230 g (~4/3 cup) semisweet chocolate chips

Make:
1. Beat together butter, sugar, and vanilla extract. Gradually beat in egg until batter is light and fluffy.
2. Sift in flour, pinch of salt, and baking soda and fold until just combined. Then fold in chocolate chips.
3. Drop spoonfuls onto greased cookie sheets (or ungreased parchment paper). Bake at 350F for 10-12 minutes until edges barely turn golden.
4. Let cool on sheet for a couple of minutes than transfer to wire racks to cool completely.

Notes:
1. Careful to not melt butter, soften just enough to make mixable.
2. Bake until edges are starting to look golden, but tops may not have much color. They will still be very soft but will firm up when cooling.
