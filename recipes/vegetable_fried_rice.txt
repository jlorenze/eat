Yield: 4-6

Time (hours): 1

Keywords: vegetarian, asian

Recommended Sides:

Ingredients:
3 Tbsp vegetable oil
3 eggs, whisked
1 small white onion, finely chopped
2 medium carrots, finely chopped
2 cups additional veggies, cut into small pieces
salt
1 Tbsp fresh ginger, finely minced
2 large cloves garlic, minced
pinch red pepper flakes
1 cup uncooked brown rice
1 cup spinach (optional)
4 green onions, chopped
1 Tbsp soy sauce
1 tsp toasted sesame oil

Make:
1. Cook brown rice according to package instructions. After cooking, spread the rice out on a sheet pan and let it cool for 5-10 minutes.
2. Prep the remaining ingredients while the rice is cooking.
3. Heat a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat, add 1.5 tsp of oil and swirl to cover the bottom. Add scrambled eggs and cook until just lightly set, flipping or stirring continuously. This will happen quite fast. Transfer eggs to a large bowl and break up into small pieces.
4. Let the skillet reheat and add 1 Tbsp oil. Add onion and carrots and cook, stirring often, until tender (~3-5 min).
5. Add remaining vegetables and salt and cook until veggies are cooked through (~3-5 min). Transfer all vegetables to the bowl with the eggs.
6. Let the skillet reheat and add 1 Tbsp oil. Add ginger, garlic, and red pepper flakes and cook for 30 seconds until fragrant, stirring constantly. Add rice and mix together.
7. Cook rice, stirring occasionally, until rice starts to turn golden on edges (~3-5 min).
8. Add the spinach and green onions and stir to combine. Add the remaining vegetables and eggs and stir to combine.
9. Remove skillet from heat and stir in soy sauce and sesame oil. Adjust soy sauce, sesame oil, and salt to taste.

Notes:
1. Use frozen/fresh peas, bell pepper, asparagus, broccoli, or cabbage for additional veggies.
2. Can also use any leftover rice rather than making it fresh.
