Pizza Margherita

Yield: 1

Time (hours): 0.5

Keywords: italian

Recommended Sides: pizza dough

Ingredients:
350g dough ball
3 oz red sauce
4 oz fresh whole-milk mozzarella
whole basil leaves
extra-virgin olive oil
fine-flake sea salt
chile flakes (optional)

Make:
1. Preheat oven with pizza stone on a rack in upper portion, about 8 inches below broiler. Temperature should be as high as your oven goes, 500-600F. Let stone preheat for 30 minutes.
2. Generously flour working surface. Remove dough from refrigerator and place on floured surface. Punch down middle of dough leaving about one inch of the outer rim undeflated, flip dough over and repeat. With both hands grab the rim and lift so dough hangs vertically, let gravity stretch the dough by running the rim between your hands to rotate the dough several times.
3. Make two fists and transfer the dough so your fists sit just inside the rim with the dough still vertically hanging. Gently stretch and turn the dough repeatedly until the dough is thin such that it is slightly translucent.
4. Spread the dough onto a floured peel.
5. Top with sauce, cheese, and basil. Slide pizza onto preheated stone and bake until cheese is melted and crust is golden.
6. Remove from oven, transfer to wooden cutting board and drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil.
7. Serve with sea salt and optional chile flakes.

Notes:
1. Pizza dough needs high heat transfer rate. This is best accomplished by baking on a preheated thermal mass such as baking stones, ceramic tiles, or cast-iron. A preheated sheet pan is better than nothing.
2. Work the dough constantly and evenly to avoid spots becoming too thin and tearing. If the dough does tear, just patch it.
3. If you don't have a peel, assemble pizza on a preheated sheet pan and assemble the pizza as quickly as you can.
4. Can also top with arugula after baking.
