Soft White Sandwich Loaf

Yield: 1

Time (hours): 8

Keywords: bread

Recommended Sides: green goddess tuna salad sandwich, french toast, grilled cheese, vegetable chowder

Ingredients:
100% unbleached all-purpose flour (350g for one loaf)
0.75% instant dried yeast (4g ~ 1 tsp)
62% water
7% honey
6% dry milk (preferably nonfat)
20% unsalted butter, softened
2.3% salt


Make:
1. Make sponge by combining half of the flour and yeast with all of the water and honey, and whisk until smooth.
2. Combine remaining flour and yeast with dry milk, sprinkle onto sponge and cover.
3. Pre-ferment for 1-4 hours at room temperature.
4. Add butter and salt and mix with wooden spoon until flour is moistened. Knead dough in bowl until it comes together, then knead on counter for 5 min.
5. Cover and let rest for 20 min, then knead for another 5 min.
6. Transfer dough to lightly oiled bowl and lightly oil surface. Cover and bulk ferment until doubled in volume (1-2 hours).
7. Gently apply a couple folds and allow to rise to double volume again (1-2 hours).
8. Shape dough by gently pressing into rectangular shape and dimpling to remove large air pockets. Fold each of the short ends a little past center and press to seal the seam. Then roll the dough about an axis perpidicular to the two previous folds while continuously pressing to seal the seam and tighten the dough's outer skin.
9. Continue shaping until desired length is reached, tucking sides under for smoother edges. Place in lightly oiled loaf pan.
10. Cover and proof (1-2 hours).
11. Preheat oven to 350F, with cast-iron skillet on lowest shelf while heating.
12. Bake for 50 min or until medium golden brown, adding 1/2 cup ice cubes to cast-iron skillet at beginning.
13. Halfway through, turn pans for even baking.
14. Cool on wire rack, optionally glaze with melted butter.

Notes:
1. Can pre-ferment in fridge 8-24 hours with 1 hour at room-temp before and after.
1. Maybe try without dry milk?
