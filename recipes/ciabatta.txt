Keywords: bread

Recommended Sides:

Ingredients:
354g (100%, 3 cups) unbleached all-purpose flour
284g (80%, 1.25 cups) water
6g (1.7%, 1.25 tsp) salt
2g (0.5%, 1/2 + 1/16 tsp) instant dried yeast
1 tsp sugar
1 Tbsp nonfat dry milk
25g (7%, 2 Tbsp) olive oil

Make:
1. Mix 177g (1.5 cups) flour, 227g (1 cup) cool water, and 1/16 tsp yeast until will combined. Cover and ferment at room temperature overnight until very active.
2. In mixer bowl, combine starter with remaining 1/2 tsp yeast, 177g (1.5 cups) flour, salt, sugar, dry milk, 57g (1/4 cup) lukewarm water, and olive oil.
3. Beat at medium speed using the flat beater for 7 minutes, until dough is very smooth and elastic. <hand-mix-wet-dough>
4. Transfer dough to a greased container. Cover and let rise for 2-3 hours, deflating midway through.
5. Turn out dough onto a greased surface, being careful not to deflate the dough.
6. Divide the dough in half to have two pieces about 10x4 inches.
7. Transfer to a greased baking sheet, and heavily dust with flour.
8. Lightly cover the loaves with plastic wrap, let rise for 1-2 hours. Midway through, dimple the loaves.
9. Spritz the dough with lukewarm water and bake at 425F until golden brown (~18-20 minutes).
10. Cool on wire rack.

Notes:
1. This dough has very high hydration, and is therefore easiest to make using a mixer.
2. If mixing by hand, it is okay to slightly increase the amount of flour (no more than 25g).
