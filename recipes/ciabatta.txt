Yield: 2

Time (hours): 16

Keywords: bread

Recommended Sides:

Ingredients:
550g (100%) bread flour
440g (80%) room temperature water
11g (2%, 2 tsp) salt
2g (0.5%, 1/2 + 1/4 tsp) instant dried yeast

Make:
1. Mix 200g flour, 200g water, and 1/4 tsp yeast until will combined. Cover and ferment at room temperature for 12-18 hours.
2. In mixer bowl, combine starter with remaining 350g flour, 240g water, 1/2 tsp yeast, and 2 tsp salt.
3. Using paddle attachment, mix on low until flour is moistened and then at medium-low speed until the dough forms a mass and pulls away from the sides of the bowl (~6 min).
4. Switch to dough hook and mix on med-low until dough is smooth and shiny (~10 min).
5. Transfer dough to a greased container. Cover and let rise for 1 hour.
6. Gently fold once per quarter-turn, gently flip dough, then let rest 45 minutes. Repeat two more times.
7. Preheat oven to 450F for one hour with cast-iron skillet on bottom rack and baking stone/baking sheet on low-middle rack.
8. Turn out dough onto a floured surface and liberally dust the top with flour, being careful not to deflate the dough!
9. Shape the dough into a square using bench scrapers, cut in half, and then transfer gently to a floured parchment paper place on another baking sheet or cutting board (for transport).
10. Lightly dimple each loaf and gently shape as desired, then cover and proof for 30 minutes until puffy.
11. Spritz the dough with lukewarm water and slide parchment paper onto baking stone/sheet. Drop a cup of ice into the cast-iron pan and quickly close oven door.
12. Bake until deep golden brown (~20-25 minutes).
10. Cool on wire rack.

Notes:
1. This dough has very high hydration, and is therefore easiest to make using a mixer. It should have a thick batter consistency after mixing.
