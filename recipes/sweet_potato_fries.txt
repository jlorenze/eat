Recommended Sides:

Ingredients:
2 lbs sweet potatoes, peeled
2 Tbsp olive oil
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp paprika
1/2 tsp black pepper
1 tsp salt

Make:
1. Preheat oven to 400F. Cut sweet potatoes into sticks.
2. Toss potatoes with olive oil, garlic powder, paprika, and black pepper, spread out on two baking sheets.
3. Bake until brown and crisp on bottom (~15 min), then flip and bake until other side is crisp (~10 min).
4. Season with salt.

Notes:
1. Definitely best fresh.
2. Spacing is very important, otherwise they end up steaming and wont get crispy.
3. Try soaking the potatoes after cutting, for about an hour, and also toss in 2 Tbsp corn starch before tossing with oil and spices.
