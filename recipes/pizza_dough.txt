Pizza Dough

Yield: 5

Time (hours): 8

Keywords: bread, italian

Recommended Sides: salad

Ingredients:
1000g (100%, 7.75 cups) all-purpose white flour
700g (70%, 3 cups) water, 90-95F
20g (2%, 4 tsp) fine sea salt
2g (0.2%, 1/2 tsp) instant dried yeast

Make:
1. In small container, hydrate yeast by adding to a few tablespoons of the water.
2. Autolyse, combining 1000g (for 5 pizzas) flour and remaining water at 90-95F and mixing. Then cover and let rest for 20-30 minutes. <autolyze>
3. Sprinkle salt and pour yeast mixture evenly over dough. Mix by hand, using the fold and cut technique until the ingredients are fully integrated. Let rest for a couple minutes, then fold until dough tightens. <fold-dough, cut-dough>
4. Cover and let dough rise until double in volume (~6 hours), applying one fold during first hour. After folding, lightly coat the dough and container with olive oil. <fold-dough>
5. Divide dough into 350g pieces (5 pieces per 1000g flour).
6. Shape dough into medium-tight balls and place on floured baking sheet. <shape-dough>
7. Lightly dust tops with flour and cover with plastic wrap, proof for 30-60 minutes. Then refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to make shaping easier.

Notes:
1. Wet your hands when mixing to keep dough from sticking. But re-wet sparingly to avoid excess water being added.
2. Be careful to not degas dough when shaping.
